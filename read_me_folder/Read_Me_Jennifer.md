## The meaning of hacking

Hacking has a West Germanic origin, related to Dutch hakken and German hacken. Since then it has become to mean many things, to some, even a philosophy or an artistic practice. Various manifestos have been written that are related to the act of hacking. Hacking, depending on various interpretations, can loosely refer to any of the following (organized by manifestos, ending with a more broad overview):
The Conscience of a Hacker by The Mentor, Written on January 8, 1986
Driven by curiosity
Understimulated by educational system
Hungry for a challenge
Discouraged by the wrong mentalities present in our systems
Unbiased
Outsmarting
Not an individual, but a collective mentality (of hackers)

#### A Hacker Manifesto [version 4.0], by McKenzie Wark, 2004
We depend on our systems (which may be flawed)
Hackers create possibilities
programming language, poetic language, math or music, curves, colourings, etc.
hackers are anti possessive
discover
anti control
anonymous

#### We Are FemTechNet, by FemTechNet.org
accessible, open, accountable, transformative and transforming educational institutions
idealism
feminist academic hacktivism
international
various disciplinary feminists sharing resources
feminist thinking about technology and innovation

#### THE CRITICAL ENGINEERING MANIFESTO, by The Critical Engineering Working Group Berlin, October 2011-2019
Engineering, most transformative language
study and exploit
expose
techonology is a challenge and a threat
raising awareness
deconstruct

re-purposed 
digital excavation
The Critical Engineer considers the exploit to be the most desirable form of exposure.

## Observational tool exercises
Hacking starts with critical or creative observation. By emphasizing our way of seeing objects and systems, we can reimagine the purpose and use of these objects or systems. There are different exercises you could do to engage yourself into a hacking mentality. 

During the Hacking practice we had an exercise to analyze a tool. 
Observe the tool for 15 minutes
Close your eyes and feel the tool
Repetitively blink with your eyes while looking at the tool
Imagine that if the tool has its own feelings, how and what the tool would feel
Write down the (emotional) perspective of the tool

My chosen tool was a pen. By reflecting not only by seeing things out of my point I find new ways of changing it. A pen, I can draw and express myself, I can also use it for my hair, the purpose of not having a pen, or not being able to fix my hair, no purpose however the idea and change can be made. We can start selling pen for setting up hair but in the other way would it be the best way of making your hair? Feeling it, also change, what is this? Small details of something, looking at it but not really looking at it, fast. creating a reflection, could be something else. Knowing it is a penn, is easy in this matter but if the tool would have been something I did not choose, would I be as sure as now? Pen perspective, I want to be able to go my own way, but you constantly forcing me to go where you want. and if I do what I want you erase me with my hair, my mark, my own way. 

I think that for the purpose of introducing someone in the act of hacking, this exercise was exquisite, because rather than just theory it is a natural way of opening people up to their own imagination.

## Sessions with Shailoh and Joana
By the first sessions we got an introduction of what they where doing, what hacking in meant for them, I remember Joana explained about her previous education as a dancer and that she could she hacking an as a geographic form, a social map. In first I did not really undersatnd the meaning but during the second session with Shailoh we made many different example on what hacking could be, the picture was more clear and to understand of seeing the pieces by them self creating the understanding in the bigger picture, to break down we need to build up, and by every pieces we put a part we learn the pattern in something.

The following is what we did during the sessions with Shailoh
What is hacking?
The world is already set, itâ€™s hard to be otherwise. Change, find loopholes. The world is full of things with no purpose which has the possibility to change, which are these things?
Boundaries, 
Surroundings
Input-(boundary)-open system(boundary)-output 

If you are not designer of a system, you just follow the method. But how could we change or hack the system? Everything leeks, data, colors. How do we hack? What happen if you change and modify the system?

Hacking example
Metro Seat, train, rails, check in system. 
Seat - metal, fabric, stuffing, screws 

Coffee machine. Coffee Beans, coups, water, milk, electricity, sugar 
System(milk). How to break in without destroying it?
Connection?! As a composer not as an object. 

Hacking Method
Find connection and identify the things.
Examples:
Tree Growing,leafs, soil, pot, changing structure of growth, making new structures by building another one.
Smoking Tobacco, paper, filter. Connection, conversations, chairing, habits, health, Sickness.
Group. Concrete place, outside school,physical. How do we function, communicate Find a way to coordinate. Structure the process. Divide the roles. Concept. Research, intervention.

## Summary on the Hacking lecture by Florian Cramer
During the course we had from Florian Cramer, he introduced us into the history of hacking. We were given a lot of historical examples of hacking. From these examples you could extract different motivations and techniques of hacking. All in all they form and shape what hacking means today.


## Anatomical drawing
We were watching a video of people in a park lying on a blanket, which slowly started to go further and further away, earth, space and galaxies, then back again and in to the body, the skin and the cells, what is there? Space and reflection, everything small can be big and everything that is big can be small.
But reflecting on every possible way we might be able to hack something. 

After the video, we had to discover alternatives to conventions of things that could be hacked or was already being hacked.
The idea of playing with what can change or what has already been made, can be very useful for the purpose of creating something new. By seeing each and everyone creating their hacks, somethines gave us a great laugh, this made me think of that this could have been the hack (our laughs) instead, insead of the actual object we created. 
We were also hacking our own bodies, creating a new perspective, close up and far away, what do we see, what do I see? Myself, but not as the way I was made in a hacking intervention from the beginning of the exercise.


## Hacking at Varia
By breaking down what is already there we can create new ways of approaching and changing the system. At hacking at varia, we also were exploring different ways of hacking. 
The hacking assignment was about hacking a soup recipe. Everyone had to bring a food ingredient. Then, during the exercise we combined all of these ingredients and created one soup out of it. We were reimagining what it means to have a recipe. We were discussing various options of rethinking how to construct or hack a recipe. We were given two new recipes, and these ones we had to hack by adding or taking away ingredients to create a new recipe. In this way hacking is not always creating something better, but more about creating something new. We learned to look more of the context of the things we regularly do, and imagine if we can do it differently.

## Reflection
As our group was very inspired by a story we read about China, where they are giving away umbrellas if it's raining outside. Another source of inspiration within our group is that we find it very important to have privacy in our daily lives in our society. 
We wanted to combine these two and intervene with the facial recognition system.
By wearing masks, which would allow us not to be able to be recorded by a face in a surveillance camera, but people in general would still be able to see who you are. We came up with the idea of using plastic and sun paper which you would normally add to the car window, but instead we added these papers to the plastic we created masks of. 
To be sure these make would be working, we tried out different face recognizing programs on the computer and also on our phones.   
As we are all different and like different things we also decide to make all the masks after each and everyone's own taste, but also we wanted to give our user the freedom to create their own personal mask, by that they can use white makers and give the mask a personal touch.
By having these masks we are hacking our way to have privacy under the eyes of the facial recognition surveillance cameras.
