Individual:

My object is a clip, which is always in my pencil case. It’s used to clip of course. Mostly, I use it to arrange my losing notes, but it’s also used to connect random things or fix things by binding two or more things together. Moreover, I unconsciously clip and unclip it as a behavior.
It’s golden and has a geometric shape. I like just watching it.

To which context:
For me, I am used to writing an idea, a note, an inspiration flash on random things. The clip helps to organize them to make sure I wouldn’t miss any important notes.
I like doing the organization of various thoughts in my head. The clip is like a mental behavior reification, which connects every piece into a complete logic ring.

glossary:
I am also connected, bound to something. I feel I am over touched and opened, closed all the time. Stop stretching me!

reflect:
I sometimes also use it as a decoration. 
I look at it from different angles. I put it on the table, on my hand and put it with paper. 
I can also use types, folders, or always bring my notebook. But the clip is still the most convenient.
From another member Phone:

The phone has already become something everyone takes with every day. There are so many apps inside, which allow people to do anything, calls, documentation, calculation, play games, watch videos, almost everything. And use the phone in every context.

To which context:
I guess the phone is mostly used to record, including photos, audios, videos, texts as an inspection tool.
