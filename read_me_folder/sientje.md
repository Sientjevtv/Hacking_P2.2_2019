Hacking     /ˈhakɪŋ/        noun
The gaining of unauthorized access to data in a system or computer.

Reading the manifesto (http://phrack.org/issues/7/3.html) during the first class 
was the first time I dove into what hacking is. I knew about the so-called ‘life hacks’ on Pinterest, but that was it. 
From the manifesto I selected a few keywords that fit the word ‘hacker’ from my perspective: 

-	Computer Crime Scandal
-	Smarter
-	Explore 
-	Seek after knowledge
-	(The crime of) curiosity
-	(The crime of) outsmarting you

After this I started researching what the internet was saying about a hack, a hacker or hacking. 
This information together with the first class gave me some interesting keywords/sentences to think about: 

-	exploring details of systems
-	stretching capabilities
-	intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system
-	programming
-	expert
-	enjoying intellectual challenges
-	going beyond limits
-	cracker
-	elite
-	infiltrating
-	exploiting weaknesses to gain access
-	illegal (?)

To hack:
-	to cut
-	to embarrass
-	to confuse 
-	to disconcert
-	to breack into
-	to cut
-	to prank
-	to crack
-	to go beyond
-	to explore
-	to stretch
-	to intrude 
 
4 steps to hack:
1.	reconnaissance
2.	catalogue and prioritize
3.	research, review
4.	test and validate


------>  2.	write down a reflection paragraph on the observational tool exercises (tip: you can link to images/ drawings);

We started with the exercise of looking at your own chosen inspection tool while blinking. 
At first I thought it was a bit silly to do and didn’t see the purpose of it, but after it helped me with one thing, which was focus. 
Because I was blinking my thoughts didn’t go all over the place. After the time was up I felt relaxed and focussed. 
This made writing the story about my inspection tool a lot easier. When I rest my head a bit, poetic triggers are coming up. 
That is what happened here as well. I really liked the writing of story from the perspective of me being the measuring tape. 
This made me realise more why I chose it as my inspection tool, so after that I wrote the ‘why I chose this’. 
Maybe not the right order to do it, but for me it worked and I even felt a bit like hacking the system. 
Here follow my written stories. 

I am a measuring tape. I can measure something for someone because I am subdivided into centimetres in millimetres. 
I myself am made of plastic, but you can also meet my friends who are from metal, textile or paper. 
We are all different in length and we are often rolled up so you can easily take us with you or store us away. 
I am more flexible than the ruler that Sientje also uses sometimes. However, ruler is used for small things, I am her favourite.  
For Sientje I mainly measure things that have to do with making her garment. 
First I measure parts of her body such as the waist and then I measure whether that length corresponds to what she has drawn 
and cut into the fabric. In this way I help her visualize whether what she is doing is right. 
For me this has nothing to do with striving to make maximum use of my capacity (length), but precisely 
the precision that I can give Sientje. I am perfect. I don’t make mistakes. If there is an error in the item of clothing, 
it is because Sientje has not paid enough attention to me. I feel that while she is using me, but I cannot let her know. 
In the end, she doesn’t ask me for advice, but for numbers. Hard numbers, there’s no arguing about that. 
I cannot argue about my strength and help. I’m perfect. 

I chose my measuring tape, because it is an important item I use very frequently. 
With this tool I combine the visualisation of a clothing piece that I’m making together with verifiable facts. 
I can measure the width of my hips and translate this to my 2D display to make it right. 
The shape is controllable and controls my visualisation. 

I also wrote a small story about a debit card, which was the inspection tool of my neighbour.

I am the debit card of R.C. Beijersbergen van Heneg. I may look like everyone else, but I am different. 
I have a code on me that no one else has and from the outside you can’t see what’s on the inside. 
I may look like nothing, but I’m worth more than you think. I’m worth a lot just like my friends, because you humans believe in us. 
We are tangible objects presenting the Rabobank system. What Rabobank does, most people don’t know, my owner doesn’t know. 
But she believes in me, because every time she lets me make contact with one of my dads the ATM machine, 
he and I make a family connection and in that way she gets convinced of my bonds with my family and friends 
and because of that my ability to give her what she wants.

------> 4.	Gather documentation on the two sessions with Shailoh and Joana;

In general we are talking about hacking involving digital systems, however I also learned about physical hacking. 
I learned how you could use anatomy as an inspection tool. Organ comes from organisation, your body infrastructure. 
In a group during the drawing class we inspected the body parts and structures of it and created a new structure 
as a fun exercise to play with hacking your own body. 

See, look, observe or view?
Shailoh and Joana talked about the difference between see, look, observe and view. 
This part really caught me. I never thought about these words together seemingly the same, but totally different. 
Seeing is ‘really seeing’ something with your eyes. Looking has something to do with seeing, but also noticing what you see. 
Watching is for me a difficult one, because it is so close in meaning to looking, but for me watching is taking it in more 
and examining it. Observing is watching with a goal connected to the brain. 
The last one is to view, which is looking involving an expectation, for example a house viewing. 
I found it very interesting how such small words that seem the same, can make a big difference in sentences and meaning. 

Affordance and interface
I was also very much triggered by the sayings about affordance and interfaces. This really took me to a new level of thinking.   

"...an affordance is neither an objective property nor a subjective property; or it is both if you like. 
An affordance cuts across the dichotomy of subjective-objective and helps us to understand its inadequacy. 
It is equally a fact of the environment and a fact of behaviour. It is both physical and psychical, yet neither. 
An affordance points both ways, to the environment and to the observer." 
― James J. Gibson, The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception: Classic Edition

After reading this several times, I’m still not sure if I understand it completely. 
What I take with me is that affordance is the perception of the function of an object. 
A door tells you how it wants to be used/how to interact with it. Pull nob down and push. 
It is a very personal matter that can be different for everyone. 

Interfaces are different. Interfaces for me are alliances between 2 systems. Through that they can communicate. 
It is a process, not a physical thing. Looking at an interface as a door or window was something that helped me understand better 
that connecting 2 things is the man purpose. 

"Interfaces are not things, but rather processes that effect a result of whatever kind. 
For this reason I will be speaking not so much about particular inter¬face objects (screens, keyboards), 
but interface effects." (..) "it is also quite common to understand interfaces less as a surface but as a doorway or window (...) 
an interface is not something that appears before you but rather is a gateway that opens up and allows passage to some place beyond.

SCAMPER
Substitute
Combine
Adapt
Modify/Magnify
Purpose
Eliminate 
Rearrange/Reverse

SCAMPER is a method invented by Bob Eberle for companies to get to/develop/improve a new service or product
Sometimes your creative brain needs a little push, SCAMPER can help you with that. 

SYSTEMS
SCAMPER can also help you to hack something. You look at an existing system and use SCAMPER to brainstorm. 
Before you do that, it is important to know what a system exactly is. 

System = a group of interacting or interrelated entities that form a unified whole. 
A system is delineated by its spatial and temporal boundaries, surrounded and influenced by its environment, 
described by its structure and purpose and expressed in its functioning.
Open systems have input and output flows, representing exchanges of matter, energy or information with their surroundings.
A closed system has no input and output (like a black hole). Almost everything is an open system, it leeks information 
and therefore can be hacked. 

CONNECTIONS
As an exercise we looked at an existing system and discussed all the sub systems and parts of the sub systems. 
In that way I noticed that everything is connected (six degrees of separation hypotheses). To take a deeper look into 
an existing system you come to understand the different kind of connections. You can for example undo a connection like with a zipper. 
This is designed to be reversible. Marriage can also be undone but not without damage. Or for example things that connect 
also often divide like a train rack. You should always ask yourself what the quality of the connection is. 
Looking at connections is looking at the way into a system. 

Kind of connections:
-	social
-	organic
-	electric
-	mechanical


------> 5.	Write a summary on the Hacking lecture by Florian Cramer;
During this lecture it was still a bit vague for me what I was thinking about hacking. 
To be honest, everything was so ‘not up my street’ at first that I couldn’t really understand and stick to the words he was saying. 
Every time he asked: Is anyone familiar with this term/product/name I wasn’t the one raising my hand. 
The one thing that did catch my thoughts was art as a example of hacking. Florian used the Urinoir from Duchamp as an example. 
The art of hacking focuses on the artistic side of hacking. 
Some people say there is a difference between hackers and crackers. 
Hackers look at systems from an artistic point of view and crackers are from the criminal side. 
Artist hackers are interested in operating as an culture hacker using computer hacking methods as an open source medium 
and strategy to reconstruct new systems, new creative environments on the internet. For example an aesthetic experience 
or an intervention of resistance. 

Although I found the lecture a bit though I kept this in mind and therefore it leaded me to my interest on the hacking field. 



------> 6.	write a summary on the exercise you developed at Varia;

 Unfortunately I weren’t able to come to this class, but I discussed and talked about it with my group. 
 I made notes with my thoughts on it. 
The morning was about hacking food. A lot of things are in connection with that such as culture, structures of stores, ingredients, 
recipes, traditions, table manners, products etc. All these aspects of food can be hacked. 
Everyone had to bring an ingredient and from that they made a soup without knowing beforehand how it was going to turn out. 
I can imagine that the first soup wasn’t tasty at all. 
After this they hacked an existing soup recipe. They adjusted to soup in a way that everyone could eat it looking at allergies, 
activism, vegetarians etc. I didn’t think about it, but something small like adjusting a recipe can also be seen as a hack. 
In the afternoon they learned about choreography as hacking. For example we hack animals by padding, training, rewarding. 
Choreography is like programming. As an exercise they looked at an inspection tool and looked at different ways of using it. 
This started a conversation. Hearing this for me made me think about the simple side of hacking. 
The first week I was overwhelmed by al the technical information about hacking. 
I forgot that hacking could also be a lot more simple and fun. I also discovered this during the drawing class where 
we had to come up with a hack. I immediately started to panic, but after that I realised I just have to come up with a 
small ‘problem’ and figure out a way to fix this using existing products/systems. 
I came up with an eye patch that had 2 wholes in it so you could wake up, do your mascara and avoid having mascara 
on your eyelid, because the patch blocks it. After figuring this out the pressure of hacking started to lower. 



------> 7.	Revise all the topics above and reflect on the possible meaning of 'Hacking' 
(Respond to the questions: What is the context in which you operated? What physical systems did you investigate? 
What did you find? What is your hacking method? If your method is a tool set, how would you explain to someone else how to use it? 
In what way are these tools limited/biased?);

1.	What is the context in which you operated?
My group and I quickly decided we wanted to intervene in a routine at home to make this project personal and relatable. 
We also wanted to make it like a joke, because we liked the fun but also critical side of hacking and its function. 
We got a lot of inspiration from Josephs lecture were he mentioned ‘chindogu’. Chindogu is Japanese and stands for ideas 
that at first sight seem like a perfect solution for a certain problem, but when you take a closer look you discover that 
it brings more problems that it solves. 

2.	What physical systems did you investigate?
We all did research about systems at home that are used during different routines. We dove deeper into rituals like: 
-	watering plants
-	locking the door
-	brushing teeth
-	eating breakfast
-	using the dishwasher
-	ticking of the clock
-	going to the toilet
-	making the bed
-	finding glasses when not on
-	using the washing machine
-	showering 

After we discussed a lot of these rituals we chose getting out of bed, eating breakfast and brushing teeth 
to investigate more in and tried to come up with hacks for them. 

3.	What did you find?
We looked into the problems that might appear when doing these rituals and mainly how to make them more efficient and easier/faster. 
-	It is hard to get out of bed
-	Making breakfast is taking to long
-	When you are tired you mix up toothpaste and hand soap so you end up putting hand soap on your toothbrush. 

Together we came up with 3 different hacks during a morning routine that look great, but actually isn’t that handy. 
With this we wanted to make a critical statement towards hacks. To emphasize this we came up with the idea of making 
a kind of commercial showing ‘Henry’ who hacked his morning routine in a way that it looks nice and efficient but it isn’t at all. 

4.	What is your hacking method?
1.	Looking at a specific area or system (in our case routines) to have a focus point.  
2.	Look at acts within this area or system. 
3.	Look at possible problems or points of improvement within this area. Put the problem on one end of the paper 
and how you want something to be or what you want to achieve on the other end. Fill the blank space in between with thoughts, 
ideas and random words. This is a way to brainstorm about an idea and to (like SCAMPER) create an incentive to use your 
creative mind and come up with an idea that links the problem with the wanted end result. This is then your hack. 

5.	If your method is a tool set, how would you explain to someone else how to use it?
We have the breakfast hack that an example of a toolset. The way to use it is to put butter in one end and jelly in the other. 
Place your bread in between en move the knife from one side to the other for a quick breakfast. 

6.	In what way are these tools limited/biased?
Our hacks are based on personal experiences, problems, routines; this makes it biased, but relatable for a lot of people 
at the same time. We chose the ‘problems’ that are most common to reach a large target group. Our concept is based around 
limits in a way. We play with the limits of certain hacks. It looks like a solid hack but the bed hack is not convenient, 
the breakfast hack makes a mess and how do you wash your hands if you have toothpaste in the soap dispenser? 
This adds a critical reflection and a laugh at the same time.

Conclusion
What is hacking for me? 

For me hacking starts with diving into the means of a system, to understand how it works operates and thinks. 
When you then redefine, reform, regenerating and reappropriate the systems or process, you can try to cross and push the boundaries 
to come up with a new system of meaning and representation in a creative way.
