#### Observational tools excersizes:
I brought a hammer multitool in for the observational tool excersize where we observed an observational tool. It was very interesting to turn a tool of inspection into the object of inspection, though some of the exersizes I found unessesary and somewhat redundant. I made a text of what the tool migjt be saying as part of the exersize. (ADD IMAGES) When we switched tools with someone I did the same for their tool of a mirror.(add Image).

#### Workshop/Classes Documentation
The intructors gave us some interesting ideas about how to view Hacking. From social hacking to how to uderstanding how thing are connected, either physically or
  
  Florian's lecture, my summary:
  I will write this at somepoint
  
  Varia workshops summary:
  gonna write about it later
  
  reflection about what i've seen and what hacking now means: 
  will post soon
  
  revise all the topics above and reflect on the possible meaning of 'Hacking' (Respond to the questions: What is the context in which you operated? What phygical systems did you investigate? What did you find? What is your hacking method? If your method is a tool set, how would you explain to someone else how to use it? In what way are these tools limited/biased?);



Hacking for us was funny annd light hearted, cuz we had seen the heavy and serious side of it, 
we wanted to choose something familiar
when you think of hacking you think of people who hack the government and banks

why this method?
  - an easy way to show multiple hacks at once
  - helped show the bigger structure of the morning routine/process
  - focusing more on the criticl statement than the actual hacks
  - narratives/storytelling is an effective way to get a message across
  - henry is like the combination of all of us, and our morning stuggles
  - the hacks are supposed to be efficient, but its also good to not rush things
  - critical statement, hacking can be good and bad, even if henry is fast and efficient he's not foolproof, hacking can be personal
