#### Observational tools excersizes:
I brought a hammer multitool in for the observational tool excersize where we observed an observational tool. It was very interesting to turn a tool of inspection into the object of inspection, though some of the exersizes I found unessesary and somewhat redundant. I made a text of what the tool migjt be saying as part of the exersize. (ADD IMAGES) When we switched tools with someone I did the same for their tool of a mirror.(add Image).

  revise all the topics above and reflect on the possible meaning of 'Hacking' (Respond to the questions: What is the context in which you operated? What phygical systems did you investigate? What did you find? What is your hacking method? If your method is a tool set, how would you explain to someone else how to use it? In what way are these tools limited/biased?);
