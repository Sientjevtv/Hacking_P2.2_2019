#### Observational tools excersizes:
I brought a hammer multitool in for the observational tool excersize where we observed an observational tool. It was very interesting to turn a tool of inspection into the object of inspection, though some of the exersizes I found unessesary and somewhat redundant. I made a text of what the tool migjt be saying as part of the exersize. (ADD IMAGES) When we switched tools with someone I did the same for their tool of a mirror.(add Image).
