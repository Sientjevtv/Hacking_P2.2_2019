## :scissors: Observational Tool Reflection :crystal_ball:
#### _Paper Scissors_

###### Performance
Separation, destruction, dissection, multiplication, reproduction, finesse, precision, calculation.
###### Context
Targeted task, crafts and creativity. To change the physical nature of your medium, or the perception.
###### The Point of View
_Consumption of others_

_To be utilized is sustenance_

_Balance and contrast_

_The safety and the danger: weighted equally_ 

_Yin and Yang_

_Each side now separated_

_A rule of two's: two legs, two hands_ 

_Diverse yet familiar, interchangeable but not the same_

_The legs form the mouth_

_They provide locomotion of the task_

_Mirrors of each other_ 

_Centered on a fulcrum, tipping back and forth rythmically_

_It is a pleasure to serve a purpose_
###### Reflection
The flashing was a good breakdown of the object's form, disassociating myself from its purpose and viewing its shapes and silhouettes. With my eyes closed, it became personal. I explored the weight and texture, and how it felt to use it. It provided the set up for the point of view. The context allowed for brainstorming alternative uses. The point of view was very valuable. Giving the object a personality and background created a thread to follow in terms of language and meaning of the object beyonds its rudimentary function.
