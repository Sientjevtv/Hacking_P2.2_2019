## :scissors: Observational Tool Reflection :crystal_ball:
#### _Paper Scissors_

###### Performance
Separation, destruction, dissection, multiplication, reproduction, finesse, precision, calculation.
###### Context
Targeted task, crafts and creativity. To change the physical nature of your medium, or the perception.
###### The Point of View


_Consumption of others_

_Utilization is sustenance_

_Balance and contrast_

_The safety and the danger: weighted equally_ 

_Yin and Yang_

_Each side now separated_

_A rule of two's: two legs, two hands_ 

_Diverse yet familiar, interchangeable but not the same_

_The legs form the mouth_

_They provide locomotion of the task_

_Mirrors of each other_ 

_Centered on a fulcrum, tipping back and forth rythmically_

_It is a pleasure to serve a purpose_


###### Reflection
The flashing was a good breakdown of the object's form, disassociating myself from its purpose and viewing its shapes and silhouettes. With my eyes closed, it became personal. I explored the weight and texture, and how it felt to use it. It provided the set up for the point of view. The context allowed for brainstorming alternative uses. The point of view was very valuable. Giving the object a personality and background created a thread to follow in terms of language and meaning of the object beyonds its rudimentary function.

#### _Anatomical Anatomic Drawing Lessons_

After some warm-up exercises, I came up with two simple hacks using the automatic doors as a mechanical tool.

<a href="https://imgflip.com/gif/32n7pg"><img src="https://i.imgflip.com/32n7pg.gif" title="made at imgflip.com"/></a>
<a href="https://imgflip.com/gif/32n7y3"><img src="https://i.imgflip.com/32n7y3.gif" title="made at imgflip.com"/></a>

Once I printed my body, I decided to explore ways to recreate my identity using my own body, collaging myself into a new living being.

This instigated the thought process for me in terms of the group hack, relating to both collaborating with technology, and reinventing identity. It also led me to introduce the idea of using actual face masks and facial recognition software.

## :arrows_clockwise: Gather Documentation :books:

#### _Reverse Engineering Machinic Choreographies_

Unfortunately I was unable to attend this lesson, however I read through the documentation, discussed it with my group, and did some independent application. These are the insights I gathered from this.

The rehearsal series was an interesting take on brainstorming techniques that I had not previously considered, and redefined the use of the word "rehearsal" in my vocabulary. This step of redefining the process and allowing it to find presence above the product is vital to refreshing my perspective within production. I can find myself overanalyzing and fine tuning a concept by tunnel-visioning on the aspects that are already present, and with this methodology can step back into a new space and navigate in a more suitable direction and finding new solutions, without losing the essence of the project.

Along the same veins of redefinition, the dive into etymology and origin of words is incredibly insightful. Traditionally I have only broken down words into its parts in order to understand the traditional definition, however in Joana's exploration of choreography and rehearsal, I understand that there are many loopholes and branches for interpretation that can be explored.

Through this process I was able to push our group toward a more developed concept, as the initial idea was not much of an alteration of a system, but more of a removal of an element in a system. We stepped back to the overarching elements and were able to go through the process to identify what was lacking.



#### _Anatomy of Connectologogy_

During the exploration of hacks, I looked at 4 different objects in the fifteen minutes.

##### _Object 1: Fire Escape Map_

![20190527_111521](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50584006/58902138-d08b8680-8702-11e9-9cca-3ac28f3e2d50.jpg)

###### *Click image to view unhacked orientation*

```

Social System - information
Tells you your location, but only when you can see it
Made up of a map of the floor, exits, points of relevant interest, a legend to define key parts, tips 
and instructionsfor specific situations, information that connects it to an electronic social system 
through the emergency number. The paper and frame are susceptible to fire, not very sturdy. Can be 
replaced with your own information or edited in some way. Can replace the phone number or give 
alternative instructions. Can be enhanced or destroyed, it holds the trust of the user, and its
expectations can be exploited.

```

##### _Object 2: Light Table_

![20190527_112111](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50584006/58902175-e13bfc80-8702-11e9-8429-aad506aa71ff.jpg)

###### *Click image to view unhacked orientation*

```

Mechanical System - electronic
Wheels, cable, light, glass, switches, hinges
Used to create transparency through electricity, in combination with paper. A giant light without a user,
otherwise a tool for a typically social purpose (art). Can be used as a sign through silhouettes imprinted 
on the cover. Without a power source it is an expensive table or paperweight, (which is ironic considering 
the paper should in fact be on top and not underneath.)

```

##### _Object 3: Vest on Display_

![20190527_110650](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50584006/58902194-ea2cce00-8702-11e9-9060-64030b431a7a.jpg)

###### *Click image to view unhacked orientation*

```

Social System - piece of art
Made up of phones, controllers, plugs, adapters, lights, beer, logos, vest, hat, pockets
Each piece can have its own mechanical function or purpose, but together they do not serve a mechanical 
function. The message of the piece can be hacked by replacing one object with another that does not belong 
to the same family, such as a sausage or a political message.

```

##### _Object 4: Emergency Exit Sign_

![20190527_111449](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50584006/58902196-eac56480-8702-11e9-84dd-a136861ddd8b.jpg)

###### *Click image to view unhacked orientation*

```

Social System - electronic
Light, battery, mount, power, glass, metal, symbol, green
Provides directions for a specific purpose, provides a source of light. The use of color to indicate safety,
a demonstration of what you should be doing, activated only in specific times, during which it switches
from an electronic to a social system. The most interesting hack is changing the symbol itself to give 
instructions about other tasks that humans should be doing in specific situations, like holding the door for
somebody behind you, or washing your hands after using the bathroom. The potential for such necessary public
signs arguably provide a greater impact on society, as their "activation" is triggered much more frequently.

```

Further discussion in small groups led us to question the differences between a door and a window, and how it is necessary to be specific and precise with the system in which you are trying to intervene, otherwise the hack does not exist or is not effective.

Quickly identifying elements and loopholes in everyday objects opened my understanding of what it means to hack a system. It provided clarity as to what can be an open system, and how easy it is to initiate a hacking process. I grew my hacker mindset by looking for weak links and simple changes to otherwise mundane systems through this exercise.

## :pager: Hacking Lecture by Florian Cramer :fax:

There was a lot of information to digest in this lecture, and there were quite a few examples that stood out to me:

- The history of hacking originated outside of the digital realm
- Targeted advertising told a woman that she was pregnant based on her purchasing trends
- Cornelia Sollfrank and her efforts within net art and female representation within the hacking sphere
- Postcode and racial profiling by Albert Heijn to cater stores toward specific demographics
- Gemeente adopting laws to combat manipulation of fake adopted children- a "reverse hack"
- Trevor Paglen's discovery of the CIA's fake Airlines in order to deport terrorists
- Jacob Appelbaum's invention of the Tor browser, and using the protection of art installations to afford immunity to the servers

Many of these hacks involve hiding information and intentionally misleading an outside group, however in some cases they are presented by an authoritative figure, and often along the lines of social hacking more-so than traditional technological hacking. They stay within orbit of the technological sphere, however the intent of these hacks are not technologically driven, which is an enlightening take on the hacking process that inspired me.

## :stew: Exercise at Varia :airplane:

As previously mentioned, I was not able to attend the lesson at Varia. I discussed the lesson with my classmates, and read through the documentation. While I was abroad, I searched for examples of hacking. One of these instances was while attending an exhibition relating to future designs and prototyping. Here are some of these examples:

This ancient runestone was repurposed as a building block centuries later, and now, another 700 years after that, has returned to its original significance, while also serving its secondary function.

The mirror by the train tracks create a piece of art from the warped industrial machinery through simply performing its duty as a mirror.

These hacks highlight an element of the hacking mentality that I find particularly interesting. That is the speculative design and future building, in that hacking and subverting norms can incite impactful change in the dynamics of how we will live our lives.
