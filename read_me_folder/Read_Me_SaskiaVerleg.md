# HACKING

_Even testen_**

____

###### DOCUMENTATION Shailoh and Joana;

The first class was about what hacking means for you (as designer). I'm a Lifestyle Transformation Design student and i'm allawys busy with the people around me and how they move in the society. My focus is on digital media and how the behavior of the people has changed due the internet and all the screens. I like to make a statement with my products/ designs to make people think about their behavior. Most of the time i show it in a future scenario. I think for me hacking is to change products and 'normal' enviroment to something else. To change the context, so people notice it and remind them of what they do and how + why they do it. To make them aware.

### What is hacking? 
different kind of hacking

- urban hacking : **intervention, critical on society, make impact, play with context**
- lifestyle hacking : **Make life easier, change patterns, change systems**
- product hacking : **change products, use products in different way, combine materials, adjust, let go of the standard** 

_Modes of inspection: observing, noticing and intervening:
To See –    A baby sees. Whoever has an instrument such as eyes, perceives the threedimensional world through them.
To Look –   Apparently, he/she begins to notice phenomena, and to distinguish between them, and it is reflected in his/her            eyes. (focus)
To Watch –  If it were up to me, I would have written point-of-viewing. The brains begin to organize one’s sight.
To Observe – This is the ultimate level, in which sight becomes intelligence, an ordered and lucid internal knowledge.
To View –   (by spectators), on the other hand, is a way of looking that involves a threat, an expectation...

### REFLECTION PARAGRAPH ON THE OBSERVATIONAL TOOL EXERCISES

##### EXERCISE,  CLASS 2 

We had to bring an inspection tool. I choose for a scissor because I use a scissor a lot to cut out images i like. We had to feel the object with our eyes closed and en look to the object in different perspectives. This excersize was hard for me, i still looked at it as a scissor. 

**We had to write down in whitch context the object could be used and how you can use it as an inspection tool. I didn't understand the assignment very well. My inspection ** (dutch): 

*scherp aan ene kant, zacht en bol aan andere kant. 2 materialen, bedoeld om dingen los van elkaar te halen, werkt alleen dmv interactief bezig te zijn, doet uit zichzelf niks, scheiden, 2 kleuren, 2 materialen, 2 losse onderdelen, knippen, loshalen, bevrijden, interactie, plek voor hand / vingers, rechtshandig?, snijden, snel te gebruiken, geen gebruiksaanwijzing, handig, licht van gewicht, te bewegen, open en dicht, 2 tegenpolen in 1 object, uit elkaar te halen, te verstellen, diverse maten, te gebruiken om iets los te halen, iets open te maken, iets te verwijderen.*

**Then we had to write down what it would like if the object would have it's own language** 

*ik ben een schaar, ik ben scherp, handig, nodig. Ik ben licht van gewicht maar vanwege mijn hefboom effect kan ik meer door knippen dan je denkt, ik besta uit 2 materialen, ik  ben 2 tegenpolen in 1 object: scherp en koud aan de ene kant, bol en rond aan de andere kant, ik wil je geen pijn doen maar je moet me wel goed gebruiken, ik ben makkelijk te bedienen. Als je denkt dat je teveel kracht moet zetten me te gebruiken, blijf dan niet duwen: ik zal breken. Ik ben te verstellen mocht dit nodig zijn, ik ben vriendelijk voor je handen. Zal mijn best doen zo scherp mogelijk te zijn, ik kom voor in kleurtjes en maten: voor ieder wat wils. ik ben er voor jou om dingen van elkaar te scheiden.*

After this assignment we had to switch our item. I got an passer and did the assignment again. It was hard to do this assignment becuase i couldn't really put the itemt out of its context.

#### CLASS JOSEPH 

We had to bring a piece of fruit and 11 parts of your body (scanned, A3 format). At first Joseph showed us a dia show in which he showed us some hacking things he liked. After that we had to make our own hack in pairs, in 20 minutes. I went downstairs and rigth away was thinking about what i could hack. I thought about some struggles i had in school, this was my starting point. After this me and my teammate coudn't really think of a big problem we could solve so we made a 'hack' with the water machine. In some kinda funny way we managed to get a drink with 2 people instead of 1. 

*for me this assignment was fun. There weren't any rules so you could do anything. This exercise made me realise that with just a small adjustment you can hack allmost everything. The 'hack' doesn't have to be so intens and big to make impact and change the system your working in. you also just have to start, don't think just do it.*

After this we had to re-created our body again. I started to cut and came out with a new body.

**A** adapt, identifies ways to construct the topic in a more flexible and adjusted material.
**M** modify, creatively changes the topic or makes a feature/idea bigger or smaller.
**P** put to another use, identifies the possible scenarios and situations where this topic can be used.
**E** eliminate, removes ideas or elements from the topic that are not valuable.
**R** reverse,  rearrange evolves a new concept from the original concept. 

something already present in world that u has hacker didn’t put there. Things full of things that are now in a way that doesn’t make sense anymore. maybe did before? 

**what is a  system?**
- group of interacting or interrelated entities that form a unified whole. surrounded by environment. 
- close system has no input and no output. But everything is part of system, things exchange. 

examples: sub system: metro 
1. people 
2. metro 
3. incheck point 

focus chairs in metro: 
1. bouten
2. schroeven
3. fabric
4. plastic 

**Everything is connected**
7 degrees of separation: een theorie die stelt dat eenieder op onze planeet, door een netwerk met zes tussenstappen of vijf tussenpersonen, met elkaar verbonden is. 

Globalisation, market, internet. 
question : can u undo the connection without any damage? 

example: fabric with zipper u can stretch it apart without any damage. Without zipper the fabric will be damaged. U CAN put it back together but never will be a s it started. 
what is the input and output that the connection support? 
connection can be transportation system to go from 1 place to another. 
How many connection can support. Look at quality, how is something made up? how easy is it to break it open? 
focus connection: looking at connection is looking in to the system. start looking to the world in a different way.
