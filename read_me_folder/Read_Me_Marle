Hacking keyword list (that keeps growing); invading, sharing, changing

The most intersting about the observational tool exercise was that I found out things I didn't know. 
My tool was key, wich have multiple things you can use them for. Opening doors, obviously. 
But also cutting, stabbing, and the keychain was for recognizability. After the exercise with closing your eyes I forgot a lot of thing.
Like that keys make a lot of sounds, are cold and that keys are a very messy object.

~The two sessions we had from Shailoh and Joana.
The first one was about manuscripts and what they told us about hacking. 
The second was about learning about you obervation tool

The hacking lecture by Florian Cramer was essencial for me understanding hacking. First I couldn't really keep up with what he was saying due to different terms.
But later he showed examples of the first hackers (model train), the cap'n crunch whisle, karagarga, etc. 
It made me realize that its super broad, the meaning hacking, and what it could be. He also told us about monoskop and ubuweb.
