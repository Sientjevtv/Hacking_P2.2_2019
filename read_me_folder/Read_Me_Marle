Hacking keyword list (that keeps growing); invading, sharing, changing

The most intersting about the observational tool exercise was that I found out things I didn't know. My tool was key, wich have multiple things you can use them for.


Check list for the Read_Me file:

select a list of keywords/ glossary about what Hacking is/ can be (tip: re-read the manifesto);
write down a reflection paragraph on the observational tool exercises (tip: you can link to images/ drawings);
grow the keywords/ glossary about what Hacking (tip: add your own references);
gather documentation on the two sessions with Shailoh and Joana;
write a summary on the Hacking lecture by Florian Cramer;
write a summary on the exercise you developed at Varia;
revise all the topics above and reflect on the possible meaning of 'Hacking' (Respond to the questions: What is the context in which you operated? What phygical systems did you investigate? What did you find? What is your hacking method? If your method is a tool set, how would you explain to someone else how to use it? In what way are these tools limited/biased?);
