### PRINCIPLES OF HACKING WITH FLORIAN CRAMER ###

- Open access
- jargon - specific terminology/slang

- Difference between the “black hat hackers” and “white hat hackers”

It´s about playing with systems and to do something unexpected with it, by 
creatively and circumventing overcoming limitations. In the past, hacked technologies (like the cap´n crunch whistle) were forming a whole subculture (with magazines like YIPL) and literature like “Steal this Book“ by Abbie Hoffmann as an example to outsmart commercial system. Looking at what else can we do with something, rather than using it the way we were being told to use it originally is a way to help broadening the personal point of view on habits and beliefs and community life in general. 

An essential part of hacking culture is free access to media of all kind, not necessarily of illegal nature. A few examples:

**_ubu.com archive / monoskop.org / aaaaarg.fail_**  
<br>Categorization often comes with inspecting something, projection something useful in the future

During the lessons I also learned about **Anatomy:**

- The study of the structure or internal workings of something
- Bodily structures of an organism
- Anatomical procedures - cutting - intervening something
- Synonynms: analysis, examination, inspection, survey, study 

### OBSERVATION TOOL EXERCISES ###

Since it is one of my most important everyday objects, I decided to bring my keychain to look beyond its simple use of opening locks. Each key has its personal assigned function and a counterpart-lock, yet they all hang onto the same keychain, connected by a ring. It comes with components of different materials (soft - medium - strong). On main feature on first sight is its sharp structure.

**Members of same family:** lock and key model -> enzymes/DNA, receptors and Passwords 

**Different uses:** 

- Scratching in softer materials than metal - wood, glass etc.
- Massaging, scratching body
- wrenching the keychain around hand
- Soundcreating (jingle-like)
