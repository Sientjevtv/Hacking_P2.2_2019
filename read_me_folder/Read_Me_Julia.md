## Introduction class Shailoh and Joana

This first lesson was about what we think hacking is, what hacking means to us, and how broad the term actually is. Anatomy appeared to be **the** key-element of hacking;

### Anatomy
= core concept for approaching hacking
*study of the structure of internal workings of something*
you cannot study anatomy without cutting something open, without intervening – similar to hacking

Connected to the body; **‘organ’** is mother-word for organisation

Differences between ‘making’ and ‘hacking’
You make something that doesn’t exist yet, but when you hack you change something that’s already there. But are we really making new things? We make things with the tools and things that are there already… so do we make or hack?

| To make: | To hack: | 
| --- | --- | 
| -	Assemble | -	Break into something
| -	Create               | -	Ways to understand
| -	Put things together  | -	Joke / prank

    “The creation of new and useful knowledge is innovation. [...] Knowledge - the output of human innovation -
    is unique amoung all other resources.   
    It's not a physical resource. [...] A wheel may break or wear out, but the idea of the wheel 
    will keep on working.” 
    -Ramez Naam, 2013   

Choreography – define movement (outside of dance aswell)
- Dance
- Organisational tool 
- Artificially

_'Choreo-graphic' -> critically engaging_

	“Choreography has become a metaphor for dynamic constellations of any kind. 
	Consciously choreographed or not, self-organising or artificially constructed (…)”


### Manifesto

**Conscience of a Hacker**

It’s one of the first hacking manifesto’s, written in 1986

kid that got arrested —> against the system —> a bit of a very subjective autobiography (like an angry tumblr post) —> kind of hate the world/self righteous —> becomes a hacker

	- alike: crowds, people belonging together, positive and negative meaning
	- problems of the time he lived in
	


**A HACKER MANIFESTO [4.0]**

How to identify the identity as a hacker; We do not own what we produce, it owns us; 

- virtuality
- ownership
- abstraction
- new possibilities
- free circulation of information
- crisis of identity


**We Are FemTechNet**

Cyber feminists, role of technology in oppression. Tech as a tool to oppress and create awareness about it. Change people’s perception and the idea’s they’ve build. 

- cyberfeminst
- anti-establishment
- education
- collaboration
- accountability


**THE CRITICAL ENGINEERING MANIFESTO**

- transformative
- repurposing
- tech is both a challenge and threat
- raises awareness
- different discipline
- exploitation/sabotage
- hacking goes beyond limits
- freedom



**THE XENOFEMINIST MANIFESTO:**

Feminists talking about the future of feminists. ‘Against nature itself’ – fields of science and tech more inclusive for women. Want to see more inclusiveness

-	feminism
-	naturalism
-	emancipation
-	techno-science
-	patriarchy 


## Notes on Florian Kramer (15-05)

properties of hacking:

| **Open access** | **Jargon** | **Playing with systems** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| info/knowledge that you create can be shared openly | terminology/slang (which we will try to unpack) | the inspecting and experimenting with systems with or without ‘breaking’ them |

	The hacker attitude is to say that something IS possible, instead of not possible.

**Given examples:**

_Blue Box_
A good example of accidental hacking is the Capn Crunch whistle. This whistle came as a toy in a cereal box, and it was discovered that the frequences of the sound could be used to hack the telephone system --> this evolved into “blue boxes” — little circuits to generate this tone and outsmart the phones, built by Steve Wozniak, one of Apple's founders. 

_Chaos Computer Club_
This men-only (geek) hacker club wouldn't accept Cornelia Sollfrank (woman and ártist) so she hacked them by thinking of a blind-spot of men: they don't know a lot about the female body, fertility and periods. A contraception-computer would do the trick; at a convention this device was dropped and showed up on the Club its website questioning the purpose of the device. By doing this she pointed out that there are still things unknown to this club and that any other member can contribute valuable knowledge to their organisation.


Hacker jargon file:
1 person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities
_E.g. Food station at school: Eating as a part of the academy instead of a service / 'together’ / Food culture as a domain that can be put in the academy_
6 hacker can also be an expert or an enthusiast of any kinds, (.e.g an astronomy expert can also be a hacker (geek, nerd))
7 one who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing limitations
8 [deprecated] a malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive information by picking around


## Inspecting and intervening
-	Observing
-	Noticing
-	Intervening

•	To see (perceiving)
•	To look (noticing phenomena)
•	To watch (brains organize sight)
•	To observe (ultimate level – sight becomes intelligence)
•	To view (by spectators – way of looking that involves a threat, an expectation..) (reference to self #GD major 2.1: society of the spectacle)

Affordances (james Gibson, 1977)
‘what you can do with stuff’ #GD major 2.2: materialresearch
- The design on everyday things (All the ways you can perceive action)
- Ways the world tells you how to interact with them (e,g. chair, door-handle, button etc.)

Hacker mentality comes in:
-	What other possibilities are there? 
-	Different interactions that are not suggested by the way the item is designed
-	Regain control about people’s behaviour

“what if you would inspect with other senses? What if the eyes were distributed, and all senses come back to touch?”


### Observational tool excercise: a reflection

The inspection tool I brought to class was my triangle ruler; We looked at the tool from our own point of view describing it's affordances and then from the tool’s point of view. The change of perspective was a bit weird to me at first, but when I started thinking about 'why would we do this' and I had to write from the triangle ruler's point of view I started thinking about it in a way I had not done before. This shift in thinking is intriguing and might be crucial to be a successful hacker?! In order to hack a system (successfully) you need to be able think from within the system.

| affordances | 
| --- |
| measuring (max. 14cm) |
| drawing straight lines | 
| draw perfect 90-angled squares |
| sharp folds in paper | 
| sharp corners punch holes in paper | 
| hard plastic can be used to stirr liquids | 
| not bendable | 

### perspective change

triangle: I'm geo, and I've known Julia for a while... it all started in highschool and I've always been a reliable measuring-tool for her. Nothing special, just maths classes! 
But now she's in artschool she's been mistreating me a little. I am being used to mix paints, punch holes in paper, and she tried to cut clay using my body!!
I enjoy helping her draw most of the times :) But I hate it when she uses me to measure things, because usually I'm too short (only 14cm) so it makes me insecure  about my size.


## Joseph @ Drawing station

Hacking by just doing without thinking too much - we printed lifesize pictures of ourselves and tried to hack ourselves.

_**I'm sorry but I cannot figure out how to put images into this document**_

The 20-minute assignment (go out and find a hack) made me curious whether it would be possible to help Joseph with his fine at the library in Wijnhaven (he told us many times that he keeps forgetting to pay and also forgets to bring the books back) - I decided to go to the library and see whether it would be possible to take a book without actually renting it (and thus avoid getting a fine). Turns out the detection gates don't beep when you just walk out with a book. (yay lifehack)

## Class at VARIA

_Hacking as a methodology_
Cooking as a cultural outing (you could hack) - We made two soups. Firstly, we made a soup with random ingredients - nobody would know on forehand that we would make a soup so we just used what we had (e.g. chocolate, avocado, apples, onion and pasta) the message/idea behind this was that _without too much communication and by just throwing items together your project doesn't really result in a very exiting endproduct._  Secondly, we hacked a soup recipe by asking ourselfs whether the ingredients would be considerate - we all tried to made a soup which everyone would like according to the recipe.

## SCAMPER method - class
SCAMPER method: substitute, combine, adapt, modify, put to another use, eliminate and reverse. = core of what happens with hacking. Why are the things the way they are? -> this method is a hacker mentality. “How are they connected? How are they composed” is the way to think if you want to start hacking something. 

System: A group of interacting of interrelated entities that form a unified whole.(see wiki for more). Open systems have input and output flows, representing exchanges of matter, energy or information. A closed system, by definition, has no input or output. Almost anything is open to a certain extent. A system is always connected to other systems; has a system inside it and is also connected to a bigger system. (zoom in and zoom out – at what level does the system become intervenable) *connectology / everything is connected*

Questions about connection: Can you undo the connection without any damage? (ex. a zipper) (anatomy) What is the kind of input/output that the connection can support? How many connections can something support? _Looking at connections is looking at how to get into a system._ 


### reflection and group project

With our group-project we discussed the safety in Rotterdam and decided to go for urban-hacking. The system we chose is the area around school, because (especially at night) it can feel quite unsafe to walk here. We wanted to know more about why it feels uncomfortable walking at those dangerous places, what made it so dangerous and how we could possibly turn this around.

After this we looked into how to hack the walking pattern of the people around those areas. Eventually we decided to make the surrounding / the dangerous place less dangerous and safer.

We researched the area and made a map by pointing out the places that we find scary around our school; for our intervention we picked is a little further from school where they are building next to the water - that path is so narrow and surrounded with construction. Imagine walking alone at night that would be really uncomfortable. Our hacking method would be that making the place less dangerous as possible by adding lights or other elements to the surrounding. We analysed the system and used it to change it.
