Definition - What does Hacking mean?

Intervening in a system, in an autonomous way. Hacking as a way of interacting with the system, is not previously, consiously designed nor 
a feature of the original system / product etc..

/ The hacker may alter the system or security features to accomplish a goal that differs from the original purpose of the system.

"A system is a group of interacting or interrelated entities that form a unified whole.[1] A system is delineated by its spatial and
temporal boundaries,surrounded and influenced by its environment, described by its structure and purpose and expressed in its functioning."
-wikipedia

Inspection tool:

The ruler

Observation with closed eyes: damaged edges sharp corners, flexible, thin.

From my point of view:
Affordances for inpection: possible to measure dimensions on flat surfaces. Possible to check angles (90 or 45). Use edges as guidlines 7
when cutting 
[tool of an inspection tool (knife)] 
-Folding papers
-use it as a mirror (reflection)
-transparent 

From the object’s point of view

I am always scared when knife is cutting along my edges. 
When I am in the bag all these other big objects pushing me around and my body is very fragile, I am sure they will break me once...
I am very refaxed and feel safe when humans use me only for drawing and keep me on their desk.
I also like when I have my own space in a drawer so ai can be with my friends with mr. glue and ms. paperclips.  Also like to meet other
objects speak the same metric language as me, for instance ms caliper is very intelligent and van measure in so many ways, I am always 
excitied when meeting her.

Reflection:

Observing phisical properties by looking, touching, moving the object around, appling force...
and using fantasy to create a story from the object’s point of view.


Mobile flash:

My point of view:
Affordances:
To make the world/ objects visible in darkness
Lighting for photography/ videography
To distract
Funcion as candle (demonstration)
Communicate group identity
Its light can shine through a human finger.

Object’s point of view

Im cool even when Iam working.
I love consuming energy.

My ideas for hacking:

My ideas are inspired by yes man. 
The 1st: the willem (kanteen) has a very strict contract, according to that they are the only one who could sell food in the academy,
which sometimes far from ideal for the community. A group of teachers/students initiated an idea to organize a food station, but it is 
not working out due to this contract.(as far as I know..)
My idea was to provoke and make a small campaign about the ‘new food station’ and announce that the food station will be established
soon in our academy. I would Print some posters and wait for reaction. 

The second idea is related to the exhibition space.  Right now it is located in the basement, which is very hidden and not very 
representative. There is a huge space in front of the blaak entrance next to the publication space which in my opinion could be the
new exhibition space. It is a very bright area. The tool would be the same, gerilla campaign, tring to hack the institution by 
reorganizing the exhibition space in an autonomous way.

 revise all the topics above and reflect on the possible meaning of 'Hacking' (Respond to the questions: What is the context in which you operated?
 What phy-gital (physical and/or digital) systems did you investigate? What did you find? What is your hacking method?
 If your method is a tool set, how would you explain to someone else how to use it? In what way are these tools limited/biased?);ű
 
 Reflextion and final outcome 
 
 We investigated dgital survaillance systems, facial recognition and the "Big Brother".
