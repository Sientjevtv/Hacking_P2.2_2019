<p>Pushing boundaries</p>
<p>By opening up a system</p>
<p>Disabling every piece</p>
<p>For piece</p>
<p>See</p>
<p>Dig</p>
<p>Turn over</p>
<p>Feel</p>
<p>Rotate</p>
<p>Look</p>
<p>Touch</p>
<p>To understand every piece</p>
<p>Change the input</p>
<p>Make</p>
<p>Experiment</p>
<p>Test</p>
<p>To have a surprising output</p>
<p>To tell something new</p>
<p>With a purpose</p>

Hacking is an infinite way to break up everything that is closed. Where new fluid ideas and thoughts flow out. But for a short period, because if the hack is a success the system will adapt to it. Hacking is a way to think and show critically how systems around us work or doesn’t. For example, James Bridle shows in a clever yet simple way the leak in the system of tomorrow; autonomous driving. Ground markings, the language where this system drives on is scarily easy to hack. Just by surrounding the vehicle with two different types of lines eliminate the vehicle. He questions how safe this system actually is, if not: is there a new system needed before everyone drives this unsafe one? So the core questions are, is everything working as it should? James Bridle raises these question and this keeps us, the society aware. Some things don’t have a focus anymore. Why are things the way they are? When we were children we always asked our parents why is this purple? Why does this stink? Where does this come from? We asked to understand the systems and the world around us. But strangely enough, the why question does not automatically stay with all of us our entire life. We are told that it is just the way it is. And take it for granted.

****Observation tool**** → 
For the observational tool exercise, you needed to bring an inspection tool. By closing my eyes, feeling and rotating the scale I had so many associations of what it could be. That really opened up the idea of the scale what it could be, mean, or the function of it. It has Nintendo buttons on the back, it smelled different on both side because of the material differences, you could use the scale to inspect yourself, or the people behind you, or above you. The perfect spy tool for in the kitchen. This exercise gave me insights into how the tool it self already can say, feel or smell a lot before you are going to research it online. This class I learned the differences between looking and observing. 

Scale’s story
No no no! You can’t stand on me. I’m too little! I will break into pieces. I know you hate my mother in the bathroom or my father at the airport. But I’m just innocent. I want to help you, tell you exactly what you have and still need. I’m not some sort of black magic, I’m straightforward, easy to understand and at all time honest. I sleep when you want me to sleep, you can change how I think from gr to ml. Whatever you want human. Turn me on and let me feel it. I will help you. You can count on me until my battery runs out.

****Sessions with Joana & Shailoh**** → 
The first session we introduced ourselves by a body part and what hacking meant for you at this moment. I introduced myself to the temperature of my body. Because I’m full of temperament and I always want to share my warmth by touching or hugging others. It was interesting to hear all the other body parts and the personal reasons behind it, also what hacking means. Some people had no idea, but overall it was about breaking into a system. At this class, I was overthinking that everything is a hack. After you Shailoh and Joana introduce yourselves it became more tangible about what hacking could look like and does, for example, the Shell tube. 

The second session was an important class for me personally. In this class, we draw the line of what hacking is. Hacking needs purpose and as soon as something gets commercialized or normalized it’s not a hack anymore. There was an interesting example of the egg you freeze in at the hospital when you want to get baby on a later time. I was really sure that it was a body hack. But it isn’t because it’s part of the system and it is arranged by the hospital. My thoughts about drinking cola as a hack stopped here immediately in this lesson. It became clear what hacking is.

****Lecture of Florian Cramer**** →
The class of Florian was essential to understand how hacking started, what it can do, mean like the accompanying symbolism, and how it is applied in different forms in daily life.

*Free phone calls / John Draper / Cap’n crunch breakfast toys*. One of the important principles of hacking is open access and playing with systems like the Cap’n crunch breakfast toys. John Draper, a former U.S. Air Force electronics technician. Draper was part of an underground culture that predated hacking as we know it: phone phreaks. These early hackers played certain tones through their telephones to bypass AT&T’s analog system and get free long-distance phone calls.

*Women Hack / Cornelia Solffrank / Chaos computer club*. The most interesting part of the class was Cornelia Sollfrank. She was a woman, she was an artist, she was not excepted by the male hackers. She dropped an ovulation calculator machine in the office of Chaos computer club. They were the biggest EU hackers, they know every machine but not this one. This was their blind spot because they are not women and therefore they don’t know and need one. This hack really shows that you don’t need to have a complicated or high tech hack just drop an ovulation calculator to hack the male members to make them aware they need a woman. 

*Hacking voting system / Rop Gonggrij*. Rop is a hacker and co-founder of XS4ALL. He gave everyone free access to the internet in early 1990. Next, to that, he did something powerful. He hacked the voting computers. He displayed a game on the voting computers to make people aware that the voting system is unreliable, so is the result of the voting. It feels harmless to show a game on it but it really communicates on a clever way that the system is open for everything, to hack the votes or to play a silly game on it. 
The core insights of this class were to be a hacker you don’t need to be a technical expert. Hacking is about systems and not technology, it doesn’t need to be complicated. That one little piece you find and hack within the system can have a big impact.

****Varia****→
Unfortunately, I missed this class because of my trip to London with my major advertising. The summary of the class was that the group made three different soups. The idea behind making soups is to hack the recipe to add for example chocolate or leave ingredients out. Not only ingredients because that’s not everything that makes the soup, soup. A recipe is a different form of an algorithm, it has different steps to get an outcome. The process and ingredients are steps, the temperature, the way you mix it, the ingredients you put in it, it is a system. I think it is a really fresh and playful way to play with the system of soup and really taste the outcome of the algorithm.

****Project****→ 
Hacking is an important aspect for every creative. At my major, we get briefs to investigate systems, routines, networks, to criticize and communicate that towards an audience by hacking the current system. The reason why I wanted to follow this practice is that I’m inspired, triggered and intrigued by artists like Aram Bartholl, Mediengruppe Bionik, Julien Berhier, Max Siedentopf, and James Bridle since they make people aware of the blind spots within today's systems by their hacks.

For the hack, my group and I wanted to hack the current way of smuggling drugs with us to parties or festivals. Nowadays these parties are designed for the usage of drugs. They sell lollipops, balloons, ice screams, etc. which we only tend to like when being high on drugs partying till the sun rises. All these clubs and festivals are thus profiting on the illegal actions of their visitors. Taking drugs with you or using it is not allowed because of the law. The well-known way of hiding these drugs is to put it deep, invisible, and close to your most intimate parts where the guard can hardly touch you. We found that when you’re acting in the most unexpected way security looks over the drugs. We hide them in plain sight by making the drugs into the gems on our jewels. The hack was tested at Now&Wow club in Rotterdam. We were wearing bracelets, necklaces, and earrings with drugs on it. We succeeded in bringing them to the party. 

We all know, drugs are no more sin, they’re being used and even encouraged doing that. Yet politics ignores this fact and want to maintain these single-minded drugless drugsfests.
