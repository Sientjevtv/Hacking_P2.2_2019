### MON 13th May

Introduced myself by component that constitutes me - my phone - An ad hoc hacking reference - hacking the human body is hacking into the societal system. 

##### Pictures of the notes I made:

##### Some key sentences on hacking:
- De Kritische Ingenieur beschouwt technologie als de meest transformerende taal van onze tijd die vorm geeft aan de manier waarop wij ons voortbewegen, communiceren en denken. Het is de taak van de Kritische Ingenieur om deze taal te bestuderen en te gebruiken, met als doel haar invloed bloot te leggen.
- new things entering the world
- XF seizes alienation as an impetus to generate new worlds. We are all alienated —
t is through, and not despite, our alienated condition that we can free ourselves from the muck of immediacy
- create, not possess
- abstraction is what every hack produces and affirms
- Information is no less real than physical matter, and is dependent on it for its existence
- The class interest of hackers lies in freeing information from its material constraints
- Every hacker is at one and the same time producer and product of the hack, and emerges in its singularity as the memory of the hack as process.
- De Kritische Ingenieur observeert de ruimte tussen de productie en consumptie van technologie.
- The elements of a free productivity exist already in an atomised form, in the productive classes. What remains is the release of its virtuality.
- The privatisation of information becomes the dominant, rather than a subsidiary, aspect of commodified life
- The hacker class arises out of the transformation of information into property
- The gift economy is the virtual proof for the parasitic and superfluous nature of vectoralists as a class.
- a vector may be any means by which information moves
- The hacker class seeks the liberation of the vector from the reign of the commodity
- to subject it to collective and democratic development
- The hack expresses knowledge in its virtuality, by producing new abstractions that do not necessarily fit the disciplinary regime of managing and commodifying education.
- Education is slavery, it enchains the mind and makes it a resource for class power
- Education is the organisation of knowledge within the constraints of scarcity. 
- Education 'disciplines' knowledge, segregating it into homogenous 'fields'
- Technoscientific innovation must be linked to a collective theoretical and political thinking in which women, queers, and the gender non-conforming play an unparalleled role. 
- It is from the virtual that the hacker produces ever-new expressions of the actual.
- The interest of the hacker class lies first and foremost in a free circulation of information- also has an interest in the representation of the hack as property
- this third politics is a stateless politics, which seeks escape from politics as such. A politics of the hack, inventing relations outside of representation.
- a crisis of identity. The hacker - has to distinguish between its competitive interest in the hack, and its collective interest in discovering a relation among hackers that expresses an open and ongoing future.
- It is not just information that must be free, but the knowledge of how to use it
- The test of a free society is the liberty for the collective transformation of the world through abstractions freely chosen and freely actualised.
- Critique is not a solution, but the problem itself (?)
- There is a politics of the unrepresentable, a politics of the presentation of the non-negotiable demand. This is politics as the refusal of representation itself, not the politics of refusing this or that representation.
- Expressive politics is the struggle to free what can be free from both versions of the commodity form - its totalising market form, and its bureaucratic state form.
- But information as property may be shared without diminishing anything but its scarcity. Information is that which can escape the commodity form.
- FemTechNet is fueled by our civil rights, anti-racist, queer, decolonizing, trans- feminist pedagogies as we work within the belly of the beast of neoliberal austerity, normalized precarity, neo-colonial techno-missionary evangelism and MOOC fever towards the radical redistribution, reinvention, and repurposing of technological, material, emotional, academic, and monetary resources.

### WED 15th May

Sad that I couldn’t be there for Florian’s lecture :(
    my thoughts on what  I understood from it: 

When I was listening to Joana talking about anatomy, I discovered a caterpillar on my leg. It was very tiny and totally black with somewhat transparent hairs. 
    I let the caterpillar crawl in my sketchbook while I was taking notes. It was the kind of notebook for math and stuff that has blocks, so I could see that the caterpillar was exactly 1 cm.
     *Pictures of the notes I made:* 

Then we did the exercises in groups with the toos wee brought. I brought the flash light of my phone. 
While I was inspecting my tool the caterpillar was still in my notebook. It tried to get away but I didn’t want it to fall on the ground and squashed under a shoe so I tried to keep it in the notebook. Someone else said if you draw a circle around it, it can’t get out. I tried. The caterpillar hesitated and then  just moved over the line without touching it. I tried thicker lines, circling around the caterpillar. That worked, the caterpillar didn’t leave the circle.
However, after a while the caterpillar somehow didn’t care anymore and escaped, maybe it’s just the fresh ink that is challenging. I drew new forms and again it worked only for a limited amount of time.
After a while, the caterpillar was gone, out of my sight.

### THURS 16th May
I missed the Anatomical Anatomic Drawing Lessons with Joseph.
Besides the hacking classes I was busy with writing text analyses and modernity essays for university. Foucault's ‘docile bodies’ and ‘the political anatomy of the detail’ interest me a lot. I hope I can find a way to connect hacking, anatomy, choreography to the final essay. - and other way around - if the political anatomy of the detail makes people into docile bodies (/ is this still the case in 2019?) , then (assuming you don’t want to be a docile body) how to take the docile out of the body and how to hack into this political anatomy.
