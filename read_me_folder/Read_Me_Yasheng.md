## **An Inspection Tool**
### Individual:
My object is a clip, which is always in my pencil case. It’s used to clip of course. Mostly, I use it to arrange my losing notes, but it’s also used to connect random things or fix things by binding two or more things together. Moreover, I unconsciously clip and unclip it as a behavior.
It’s golden and has a geometric shape. I like just watching it.

To which context:
For me, I am used to writing an idea, a note, an inspiration flash on random things. The clip helps to organize them to make sure I wouldn’t miss any important notes.
I like doing the organization of various thoughts in my head. The clip is like a mental behavior reification, which connects every piece into a complete logic ring.

glossary:
I am also connected, bound to something. I feel I am over touched and opened, closed all the time. Stop stretching me!

members:
rope, folder, file, stapler, box, pen, case, wire

reflect:
I sometimes also use it as a decoration. 
I look at it from different angles. I put it on the table, on my hand and put it with paper. 
I can also use types, folders, or always bring my notebook. But the clip is still the most convenient.
