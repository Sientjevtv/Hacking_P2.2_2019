##### Checklist Hacking
1. select a list of keywords/ glossary about what Hacking is/ can be (tip: re-read the manifesto);
2. write down a reflection paragraph on the observational tool exercises (tip: you can link to images/ drawings);
3. grow the keywords/ glossary about what Hacking (tip: add your own references);
4. gather documentation on the two sessions with Shailoh and Joana;
5. write a summary on the Hacking lecture by Florian Cramer;
6. write a summary on the exercise you developed at Varia;

# MONDAY 13th May
##### Class with Shailoh and Joana

The practice started with a detailed schedule and planning in GitHub that was sent to us by mail. I appreciated this, because (what I didn't know then) it was the tool we would be working with ourselves, a gentle way to introduce us to GitHub.
Not only did it show what was expected from us, but also what we could be expecting from te practice.
For the first class it already told us to introduce ourselves through a component that 'constituted' us, and come up with a hacking-reference.

The component that constitutes me, or actually completely does NOT, is verbal communication. It has always been a struggle for me to find the right words, to talk loudly, to show confidence and show off what I can do and know. I always prefer other ways of sharing my knowlegde, because I often seem to be lost when in my mind it's all there.

I found it hard to come up with a hack. Because it was our first meeting, I wasn't sure what to expect and in what direction I was supposed to be thinking. The thing that popped up was my boyfriend, who always makes systems* out of things that have another purpose. For example: He once made a 'hand stabiliser' for his camera, by using a potato peeler as a handle and moving mechanism. I thought hat was an absolutely amazing hack.

After the joint introduction, Shailoh and Joana introduced us to their connection to hacking. I had, and still have a bit of a hard time to understand Joana's work. It seems to me like she is very much into coding and digital hacking, which I do not have or feel any shared interest in. Shailoh seemed more into the understanding of systems, how things can be viewed from different persectives in order to find possible hacks. That is what I expected and hoped for, when I applied for this class.
At the end of this day I got a bit lost for directions, but the next day fixed it all for me.

Also the Hackers' Manifesto was very helpful for me in order to understand the principles of hacking.

- Introduced ourselves through a hacking reference
- Introduction Shailoh and Joana
- Read A HACKER MANIFESTO, 'Manifestation & Hacking'and defining the text through 5 words:
> abstraction
> representation
> identity
> ownership
> virtuality

# WEDNESDAY 15th May
##### Lecture with Florian Cramer and exercises with Shailoh and Joana

Florian is a great teacher, if you would ask me. He really cares about what he stands for and less about the rules and ways things are 'supposed' to be. In my dummy I made so many notes that I can't tell what hit me the most. Of course it was exciting that he gave us an insight of the illegal activities that a big part of hacking also consists of. What really intregues me was his ability to make these illegal activities seem legal, accessible and even 'fair'. In a way he hacked our minds, because we all know very well certain things are unacceptable, but he mastered the way of speaking and almost infiltrating in our minds, to make us doubt the damage these tings do.

He also really interacted with us and listened to what we had to say, ask and use it to go somewhere.
To me, his lecture was very useful in a way that the examples weren't the main information that helped me, but his lecture in general gave me a boost.

- A lecture on the history of hacking by Florian Cramer.
- A presentation with some core concepts and references: Inspecting & Intervening Phygital Anatomies (physical and digital)
- Warming up exercise with our brought inspection tool
- Formed a group for the project with Malou (Product Design), Steffie (Product Design), Oriane (Graphic Design) and me, Romy (Fine Arts & Teacher Training).

## Reflection on the observational tool exercises

First of all, I think it's too bad that the scan I made of the notes in my dummy is so zoomed-in that you can't really see it as it's supposed to be immediately. Possibly my GitHub skills are to be blammed for this.
The exercise made me feel and experience what the presentation was saying. The exercise was accessible and easy, but to be executed well in order to understand the concept. 

You can read all my findings in the notes, but something that got my attention was the 'MADE IN CHINA' printed on the tool I had. There was more information but this particular information was printed in the largest font, as if it was the most important. While it actualy had notinh to do with the inspection tool itself, in any way. 
It also had a magnet to help the functionality, which I don't think I would have noticed if I had just used it.

# TUESDAY 21th May
##### Workshop with Niek at Varia

Today I thought was a bit unexpected. We each brought an ingredient, which turned out to serve in a soup. All ingredients were mxed; pepper, chocolate, jam, cucumber, avocado, apple, onion, etc. Some students tried the soup, so did I and I thought it tasted okay, it only needed salt and then i would have actually eaten it. It turned out salt is quite essential in a soup.

Then we got a little lecture about hacking receipes, with an example of the famous 'Elizabeth sponge cake' receipe. Honestly I do get that hacking a soup is a different insight on hacking but I think everything we learned was quite obvious and he could have taken it further for me in order to really show me something new and interesting to trigger me.

After the lecture the group was devided in two, and each group hacked an existing receipe. We had a tomato soup, and left out the stock and replaced it with salt and locally grown herbs to make it more considerate. We also left out the sour cream because of the possible allergies and the use of animals. We thought of replacing both the fat from the stock and the sour cream with coconutmilk, but this had an E-number in it, which turned out to be having the alomst same molecules as plastic.
Our soup turned out to be animal-, E-number- and foreign product free. I think we did a good job, but I wouldn't call this hacking.

Why I wouldn't say this is hacking: you could have just made the soup according to the existing receipe but using local, biological and vegan ingredients. These days you don't even have to change a single thing about a receipe in order to make it considerate, as we did.
Basically we did the same thing but we didn't have access to other ingredients other than what Niek already bought for us and had in his storage.
Despite my critique I am glad we had a different class and setting; it was really light and open and there was no pressure. I also really loved the location. Altogether this morning lifted some of the heaviness of hacking from my shoulders.

- Introduction about food hacking by Niek and making a soup with the ingredients we brought
- Small presentation about hacking food
- Hacking an existing receipe in a group, to make it as 'considerate' possible
- Eating the soup from the other group

- Embodiment: a series of movement exercises
- Presentation by Joana about Geographic Coding
- Reading the text 'Geographic Object'
- Exercise: connecting terms with theories

- Practice: work in groups and choose an object to inspect the choreography of it, make a new choreography.
- Group presentations of choreographies

With the 'exercise we developed at Varia' I think you mean the new choreography we developed. We chose a bag of ready-to-eat carrots and started by looking at the common ritual of using them. We went through every possible way to prepare and eat them. We then looked at ways they're not supposed to be used, such as eating the plastic and throwing away the carrots, putting the entire thing on a shelf and let it become art; it will bow up, start to decay and maybe eventually explode. I really like the Idea ov living art, but the idea that we went with was using the carrots as a natural writing or coloring tool. we practiced in my dummy, they are the ideal size to hold. The only problem, which I found out after the class was finished, is that it becomes almost invisible after it has fully dried down.

The afternoon, when we did some choreographies with Joana, I didn't quite get it. It would have worked way better if we'd have some more space. We walked around creating our own personal space ad listen to music. When the tempo got up, we apparently were supposed to be influsenced by the increasing tempo and start walking faster, but we did not. I get the Idea, but next time I would make some more space, so that we actually have the room to move freely.
It was nice though to exoerience a complete different day and be out of the academy for a day.

# MONDAY 27th May
##### Workshop with Shailoh about the 'Anatomy of Connectology'

- Shailoh explaining connectology and systems, and discussing with the class
- Looking for an existing system and how it's connected, how and if it can be disconnected and what happens
- Started brainstorming on our own idea of a hack, using the SCAMPER method.

#### With Malou and Steffie
Today our project really started going because of Shailoh's introduction to the SCAMPER method.
We each chose a piece of clothing and adjusted the method to it, which turned out to be harder than I thought. At first it seemed like all the questions were quite similar but put in different words. I chose to investigate a coat, that lead me to start questioning if such things as Gucci did with the bathing suit (making is so much 'designer' that it can't rwally function as a bathing suit anymore) is still considered hacking. How far can we go? 
There are many links and steps here that we took in a short time. After Malou left Steffie and I dove into the rules and borders of public nudity; when a woman is considered naked, and if see through or really form fitting also is considered naked. We actually inspected article 430A by the department of justice that states about public nudity. Because even the article can't draw straight lines on the rules, I reached out to the department of justice myself. The lady replies that this was a great question and that she also couln't answer it, so the had to contact another department.
Because this took too lng for the time we had.

# FRIDAY 31th May
##### Self directed working on a hack

#### With Oriane and Malou
Today we gathered at the rooftop to collect references and decide on what exactly we want to hack.
We made a list of references and a start up plan you that you can find below:
### https://github.com/somsromy/Files/blob/master/Hacking.md

After Malou left, Oriane and I went to the city centre to look for shoes that we coudl use and took some pictures.

# MONDAY 3th June
##### Self directed working on the production

#### With Oriane
Today we met at the city centre to start with buying shoes. We have a group chat, in which we shared our findings and together we chose a pair of shoes. We chose the Balenciaga Triple S shoe to go with. We already brought paint and possible additives for teh shoes from home. (Malou's granddad died this weekend, so unfortunately she couldn't be with us.) It was achtually really good that it was just the two of us, because we have each worked on a shoe for almost for hours, painting them identical.

We experienced the proces and it brought us closer to the idea of the hack; it was not just about hacking a brand or a product, but it was about hacking the ### Value.
